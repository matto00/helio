# cleanup.sh — canonical Phase-4 (post-merge) teardown for the ticket-delivery flow.
#
# Stops the dev servers bound to this ticket's ports, removes the worktree,
# and fast-forwards local <base> (default: main) to match the fetched remote
# (CON-25) — Phase 4 is the one moment the workflow knows, synchronously, that
# a merge just happened, so it is the natural place to bring the base forward
# before it goes stale for the next run. Safe to re-run.
#
# DESTRUCTIVE — Phase-4 only. This script removes the live worktree and kills
# the dev servers. It must run ONLY as the orchestrator's post-merge teardown,
# never mid-review. To guard against a stray invocation it refuses to do any
# work unless an explicit Phase-4 opt-in is present:
#   - the first argument is `--phase4`, OR
#   - the environment sentinel `CONCERTINO_PHASE4=1` is set.
# Without the opt-in it prints a refusal to stderr and exits 0 (safe no-op).
#
# Usage: cleanup.sh --phase4 <WORKTREE_PATH> <DEV_PORT> <BACKEND_PORT> [TICKET_ID]
#    or: CONCERTINO_PHASE4=1 cleanup.sh <WORKTREE_PATH> <DEV_PORT> <BACKEND_PORT> [TICKET_ID]
#
# Prints "READY cleaned worktree=<path>" on success — ALWAYS exits 0,
# regardless of whether the fast-forward below succeeded, escalated, or was
# skipped. A stale base is a risk for the NEXT run, never a reason to leave
# THIS already-merged ticket's teardown incomplete.
# ===========================================================================

# Phase-4 guard: proceed with the destructive steps only on explicit opt-in.
