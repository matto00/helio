# await-sentinel.sh (CON-178) — bounded, self-terminating poll for a
# sentinel file, replacing the ad-hoc `until [ -f "$SENTINEL" ]; do sleep N;
# done` loop orchestrators previously improvised (and backgrounded) whenever
# their harness could not block inline on a spawned sub-agent.
#
# The incident this fixes: a sub-agent's result normally arrives through the
# ordinary blocking spawn/resume call returning (see core/roles/orchestrator
# .md's "Harness resume model"), NOT through the sentinel file. So once that
# call returned, the backgrounded poller kept sleeping on a file that would
# never appear -- for the rest of the session. One real run (HEL-533,
# 2026-09-10) leaked 18 such idle shells this way.
#
# This closes the leak by construction, not by cleanup:
#
#   1. It is a single FOREGROUND, BOUNDED call. It ALWAYS exits on its own
#      -- either the sentinel appears, or TIMEOUT_SEC elapses -- so nothing
#      is ever left running past the call returning, whether or not the
#      caller itself backgrounds the call.
#   2. The ONLY completion signal is the sentinel file's existence, checked
#      by this process alone. It never polls by process/pattern match (no
#      `pgrep -f`, no `pkill`): a `pgrep -f "<pattern>"` waiter can match
#      its own command line and deadlock waiting on itself -- exactly the
#      sibling bug CON-178 explicitly must not reintroduce.
#
# If a caller backgrounds this script anyway (e.g. because a single Bash
# tool call has a shorter timeout than the wait could take) and later
# obtains the result through the normal blocking-call path FIRST, the
# caller must kill this script's PID itself rather than let it run out its
# own timeout -- see "Harness resume model" in core/roles/orchestrator.md
# for the instruction this script exists to support. This script cannot
# detect that on its own: it has no visibility into the caller's other,
# unrelated completion path.
#
# Usage: await-sentinel.sh <SENTINEL_PATH> <TIMEOUT_SEC> [POLL_INTERVAL_SEC]
#   <SENTINEL_PATH>       file whose existence signals completion.
#   <TIMEOUT_SEC>         hard bound in seconds; on expiry this script exits
#                         1 -- it never waits unboundedly. Clamped to
#                         MAX_TIMEOUT_SEC (below) -- the script's own
#                         self-termination guarantee would otherwise be
#                         only nominal for a caller who (accidentally or
#                         not) passes something like 86400.
#   [POLL_INTERVAL_SEC]   seconds between existence checks (default: 2).
#
# MAX_TIMEOUT_SEC: hard ceiling on TIMEOUT_SEC, 1800s (30 minutes) by
# default -- long enough for any real sub-agent phase this repo's
# orchestrator role waits on, short enough that a poller can never
# meaningfully "leak" for the rest of a session even if a caller never
# reaps it by PID. Override via the AWAIT_SENTINEL_MAX_TIMEOUT_SEC
# environment variable for an unusual case; there is no way to disable
# the cap entirely -- CON-178 exists because loose "just pick a big
# number" bounds do not hold up in practice.
