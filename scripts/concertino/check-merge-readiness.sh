# check-merge-readiness.sh — deterministic pre-merge gate for the auditor
# (agent-merge).
#
# Usage:
#   check-merge-readiness.sh <WORKTREE_PATH> <BRANCH> <TICKET_ID> <ARCHIVE_PREFIX>
#
# <ARCHIVE_PREFIX> (CON-166, design.md Decision 1a) is the repo-root-relative
# path (e.g. `openspec`, or `spec` for a `kind: none` spec provider) whose
# planning-artifact tree condition 3's SHA-drift check ignores. Never
# hardcoded — it is supplied by the caller (the auditor role, from its
# resolved change-dir root) so a project archiving under a different prefix
# is not refused on every delivery.
#
# Checks, in one invocation, the three MACHINE-VERIFIABLE conditions a safe
# merge requires. The fourth condition a merge requires — the diff actually
# satisfies the ticket's acceptance criteria — is cold subjective judgment
# and stays entirely with the auditor; this script never attempts it.
#
#   0. Reconcile BEHIND  — if the PR is behind its base when this script
#      starts, merge the base into BRANCH once, push, and let conditions 1-2
#      re-derive fresh state on the new HEAD, instead of failing outright.
#      Current work is never discarded: a merge (not a rebase/force-push)
#      is used, and a real conflict aborts the merge and falls through to
#      the ordinary BEHIND failure below for a human to resolve. See
#      "Reconciliation (condition 0)" below.
#   1. CI green      — every check reported on BRANCH's PR is SUCCESS,
#      SKIPPED or NEUTRAL. SKIPPED/NEUTRAL are terminal non-failures, not
#      passes-in-waiting: a workflow that deliberately no-ops on PRs it
#      does not apply to (e.g. a Dependabot-metadata job gated on the PR
#      author) reports SKIPPED on every other PR, and treating that as a
#      failed check fails closed on every such PR forever. A
#      PENDING/QUEUED/IN_PROGRESS/missing conclusion is a DISTINCT failure
#      from an actual failed check ("a pending check is not a pass" — the
#      ticket is explicit these are never collapsed into one message), but
#      it is not an immediate fail either: this script polls, bounded by
#      CONCERTINO_CI_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SEC, before giving up. An empty rollup (no
#      checks configured) passes immediately.
#   2. Mergeable     — mergeStateStatus == CLEAN passes. BEHIND/DIRTY/
#      UNSTABLE/BLOCKED fail naming the status, except BLOCKED with
#      reviewDecision == REVIEW_REQUIRED, which fails with the specific
#      "branch protection requires human review" reason instead of a
#      generic one. UNKNOWN — GitHub's transient still-computing state,
#      expected right after this script's own reconciliation push, or after
#      Phase 3's `git push` + `gh pr create` — is polled, bounded by
#      CONCERTINO_MERGE_RECHECK_TIMEOUT_SEC, before giving up. DRAFT or
#      anything else not enumerated here fails CLOSED immediately as
#      "mergeability not yet determined: <status>", never falling through to
#      a silent pass.
#   3. This run's own gates passed — the latest role=evaluator `verdict`
#      event in this ticket's event log (read from the MAIN checkout, the
#      same resolution emit-event.sh uses) is PASS, and the latest
#      role=skeptic `verdict` event is CONFIRM. (Why "latest" is sufficient
#      without a separate design/final `gate` field: see design.md
#      Decision 2 of the agent-merge-role change — by construction, the
#      final-gate CONFIRM is always the most recent by the time the auditor
#      runs.) CON-152: the skeptic leg is ALSO satisfied when the human
#      answered a budget-exhaustion escalation `proceed-to-delivery` AFTER
#      that latest skeptic verdict — an owner override, reported as such
#      rather than as a CONFIRM. Read from `escalation.answered`, which only
#      emit-event.sh's resolution path writes from a human's answer file, so
#      no agent can forge it; an orchestrator-written verdict never clears
#      this gate.
#
#      CON-166: condition 3 ALSO refuses when reviewed source content has
#      moved. Verdicts now carry the SHA the role actually reviewed
#      (`head_sha`, see emit-event.sh). The head actually being merged is
#      GitHub's `headRefOid` (Decision 5), not local HEAD — the two are
#      asserted equal (one re-query on a transient mismatch) before any
#      comparison runs; a surviving mismatch is EXIT 1, not a stale outcome,
#      since no amount of re-review fixes a diverged push. For each of the
#      evaluator's latest PASS and the skeptic's latest CONFIRM, the check
#      unions the paths the branch touched (relative to a freshly-fetched
#      base ref) at review time and now, and refuses if that reviewed-vs-head
#      diff — excluding only <ARCHIVE_PREFIX> — is non-empty (design.md
#      Decision 1). A CON-152 owner override waives the skeptic leg only
#      (Decision 6); the evaluator leg is never waived. See "STALE" below.
#
# Prints "PASS" and exits 0 only when conditions 1-3 hold. Otherwise prints
# one "FAIL <reason>" line per failed condition to stderr and exits
# non-zero — the same stdout/stderr contract assert-phase.sh already uses.
#
# CON-159: a check that is merely STILL RUNNING when the wait window expires
# is reported distinctly — one "PENDING <names>" line, exit code 3 — and is
# NOT a FAIL. The two states were previously indistinguishable, so a repo
# whose slowest required check outruns the window (helio's Scala `backend`
# job takes ~12m against a 7m default) escalated to a human on EVERY PR,
# for a run that was simply not finished yet. The window cannot just be
# raised past the slowest job: the caller's tool timeout (10m, see below)
# bounds how long this script may block at all. So the script stays under
# that ceiling and hands the caller a resumable "not yet" instead of a
# verdict. The caller re-invokes; it does not escalate. Conditions 2-3 are
# skipped in that case — they would be judging a HEAD whose CI is still
# moving.
#
# A
# failure whose reason begins "could not query ... via gh" is an
# environmental failure (gh unauthenticated, GitHub unreachable) — the
# auditor treats that shape of failure as BLOCKER, and every other failure
# as a named ESCALATE reason.
#
# CON-166: a stale reviewed SHA is reported as one "STALE <reason>" line
# per stale role, exit code 4 — distinct from exit 1 ("failed", nothing
# short of a fix clears it), CON-159's exit 3 ("wait, re-invoke unchanged"),
# and a real "FAIL". Exit 4 means "do work (re-run that gate on the current
# head), then re-invoke this script" — a script cannot spawn the agent that
# does that work itself (design.md Decision 4), so remediation is a prompt
# obligation on the orchestrator, triggered by this exit code. The auditor's
# own script-owned lease is NOT released on exit 4 (design.md Decision 4a) —
# unchanged from every other outcome: only the auditor's own verdict emission
# releases it (see emit-event.sh). If a hard FAIL and a stale verdict are
# both present, exit 1 dominates (design.md Decision 6a) — a "do work and
# re-invoke" signal must never mask a failure no amount of re-review clears.
#

# This invocation can block for a while (bounded by the two timeouts below,
# worst case a few minutes) — a caller invoking this via a tool with its own
# default timeout (e.g. a 2-minute default Bash-tool timeout) must raise it
# explicitly, or a still-genuinely-pending CI run reads as a tool timeout
# instead of the "CI pending after Ns" FAIL this script would otherwise
# produce on its own.
