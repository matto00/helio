# watchdog.sh — two-signal fleet staleness watchdog (CON-177).
#
# Rebuilt from a driving session's scratchpad at least three times
# (2026-07-20, 2026-09-08, 2026-09-10) before landing here; each rebuild
# reintroduced constraints this script now exists to preserve permanently.
# A cold review pass (cycle 2) found real gaps in the first landed version —
# see the constraint-by-constraint comments below for what changed and why.
#
# Usage: watchdog.sh <tasks-dir> <lanes-file>
#   <tasks-dir>  directory whose `a*.output` entries are transcripts (real
#                files or, in this repo, symlinks into subagents/agent-*.jsonl)
#                to STAT ONLY — never read for content (constraint 3). Must
#                already exist (validated at startup, exit 2 otherwise).
#   <lanes-file> the watchdog's liveness input, NOT inferred from silence.
#                Must already exist (an empty file is fine — create one to
#                mean "no lanes yet"; a missing path is a usage error, exit
#                2, not a silent stand-down). One line per lane in flight:
#                  <agentId> <label> [<TICKET>]
#                Blank lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored. The
#                driver owns this file and should edit it atomically (write
#                to a temp file in the same directory, then `mv` over the
#                original) — a plain truncate-then-rewrite can be caught
#                mid-poll and briefly read as empty, which this script would
#                (correctly, per constraint 7) read as "no lanes live" for
#                that one poll.
#
#                The optional 3rd field is a ticket id, spelled either
#                  TICKET
#                or, when this watchdog's own CWD is not (or will not stay)
#                inside the repo that ticket belongs to,
#                  TICKET@/absolute/path/to/that/repo
#                When present, this script treats that lane as complete — no
#                LANE trip, and it doesn't count toward keeping the fleet
#                "live" for FLEET purposes — the moment
#                  <repo root>/.concertino/runs/<TICKET>/events.jsonl
#                contains a `"kind":"run.end"` line (the same terminal-event
#                marker cleanup.sh's other_runs_live() and
#                lib/ui/retention.js's hasRunEnd() already use; TICKET is
#                matched case-insensitively, uppercased the same way
#                emit-event.sh normalises it before writing that path). This
#                is a REAL completion signal, not driver discipline: a lane
#                whose line was never removed after it actually finished is
#                detected as finished anyway, so forgetting to edit the file
#                (the exact 2026-09-10 incident) can no longer produce a
#                false FLEET trip. A line with no 3rd field falls back to
#                pure liveness-by-file-presence, as before.
#
#                <repo root> resolution order (cycle-3 fix — the CWD-only
#                lookup silently never detected completion, and fell back to
#                a TRIP FLEET, when this watchdog was launched from outside
#                the consumer repo: a scratchpad, a driving session in a
#                DIFFERENT repo, or a worktree a later cleanup.sh deletes):
#                  1. the inline `@/abs/path` on that lane's own line, if any
#                  2. $CONCERTINO_REPO_ROOT, if set (a single default root —
#                     insufficient on its own for a driver tracking lanes
#                     across two repos at once, which is why (1) exists and
#                     always wins per-lane)
#                  3. `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` from this script's own
#                     CWD, same as emit-event.sh's main_checkout()
#                A ticket whose root can't be resolved by any of the three
#                warns once on stderr and is treated as not-yet-complete
#                (falls back to plain liveness-by-file-presence) rather than
#                silently misjudging it either way.
#
#                All tracked lanes complete (by either removal or the
#                run.end signal) ⇒ silent stand-down, exit 0, no TRIP text
#                (constraint 7).
#
# Two signals, because one mtime is the wrong signal on its own:
#   FLEET (strong): newest mtime across ALL tasks-dir transcripts is older
#     than the fleet threshold *while at least one lane is still tracked and
#     not yet complete* — nothing anywhere is writing even though the driver
#     still thinks work is outstanding. This is the real stall detector.
#   LANE (weak): one tracked, not-yet-complete lane's own transcript is older
#     than the lane threshold — may be parked mid-handoff, may be a child
#     legitimately still working (constraint 6: diagnose, never kill).
#
# Env overrides (constraint-testability — see test/scripts/watchdog.test.sh):
#   WATCHDOG_FLEET_SEC  fleet threshold in seconds (default 900  = 15 min)
#   WATCHDOG_LANE_SEC   lane threshold in seconds  (default 10800 = 3 h;
#                       constraint 4 — must stay >= 3h in production; only
#                       tests should lower it)
#   WATCHDOG_POLL_SEC   poll interval in seconds   (default 60)
#
# Exit codes: 0 stood down / superseded, 1 TRIP (FLEET or LANE), 2 usage error.

# FILE's contents with a separate `cat` then a separate `rm` — two operations
# with a window between them where a brand-new instance could write its own
# PID into the file after the old instance's `cat` had already read "yes,
# that's me" but before its `rm` ran, so the old instance's cleanup deleted
# the NEW instance's lock and left nothing running. `mkdir`/`rmdir` have no
# such window: only whichever instance's `mkdir` actually succeeded may ever
# write the PID file inside, and only that same instance's cleanup path can
